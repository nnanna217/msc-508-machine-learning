## Task - Predict potential occurrence of Heart disease given patient medical history

This project predicts potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. 
This is a classification problem, and the approaches sampled include perceptron, Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and Decision tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.

## Training
In this project, I took six algorithms, varied their parameters, and compared the final models. The algorithms included Perceptron, Logistic Regression, LogK Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. I split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data.

## Model Selection
**Linear Regression Model** - used to predict a continuous dependent variable (y) based on one or more independent variables (x)
**Perceptron** - A perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used in supervised learning. It is a single-layer neural network that takes in a set of inputs and produces a single output. The output is determined by a linear combination of the inputs and a set of weights. The perceptron is trained by adjusting the weights until the desired output is achieved.
**Logistic Regression Model** - a model used for predicting the probability of a categorical dependent variable.
**K-Nearest Neighbours** - It is a non-parametric method which classifies data based on its similarity to other data points in the training set. The algorithm finds the k-nearest data points
**Support Vector Model**- SVMs are based on the concept of decision planes that define decision boundaries. A decision plane is a line that separates two classes of data. SVMs use a set of mathematical functions to determine the best decision plane that maximizes the margin of separation between the two classes.
**Decision Tree** - The goal of the decision tree is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features
**Random Forest** - is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Model Evaluation
For this project, the metrics used to measure and compare between models are Accuracy & Confusion Matrix.
